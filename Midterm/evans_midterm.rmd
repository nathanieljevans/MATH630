# Free Answer Questions 
##1. 
###The probability density function of a random variable X is given by:

f(x) = (
cx, 0 < x < 4
0, otherwise
###a. find c
$$ \int_{0}^{4} cx = 1  --> c = 1/8  $$ 

#### Answer: c=1/8
#### Explanation: To find c, we use the probability density function property that the integral over all space of the PDF must be equal to 1. Since we know the PDF is 0 everywhere except 0-4, we can integrate over this region and solve for c such that the above integral computes to 1. 


###b. find the cumulative distribution function F(x).

####Answer:
$$ F(x) = \int f(x) = \frac{1}{16} \times x^2 , \space {0 < x < 4}\\1, \space x \geq 4\\0, \space x  \leq 0 $$
####Explanation: The CDF is the integral of our PDF and since we know that the CDF at + infinity must be equal to 1 and the CDF at - infinity must be 0 then we can apply this range to the non-zero portions of the PDF, 0-4, using CDF(0) = 0 or CDF(4) = 1 to solve for the integration constant. This is essentially what we did in part a. 

###c. Compute P(1 < X < 3)
####Answer: 1/2 

####Explanation: 
$$P(1 < X < 3) = \int_{1}^{3} f(x) = F(3) - F(1) = \frac{1}{16}(3^2 - 1^2) = 0.5 $$

##2. 
### A friend claims that she has drawn a random sample of size 30 from the exponential distribution with
$$ \lambda = 1/10 \\ \bar{x} = 12$$

###a. What is the expected value of a sample mean? [hint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution#Mean.2C_variance.2C_moments_and_median)
####Answer:
$$ E[X]= \frac{1}{\lambda} = 10 $$ 
####Explanation: The answer can be taken from posted E[x] equation for a exponential distribution but to derive this we should be able to integrate from -inf to Ex and set that equal to 0.5 to solve for Ex. However, this doesn't seem to give the wiki posted answer. I'll want to talk about this after the test.

###b. Run a simulation by drawing 1000 random samples, each of size 30 from Exp(1/10), and then compute the mean. What proportion of the sample means are as large or larger than 12?

```{r}
set.seed(0)
x <- rexp(1000, rate = 0.1)
xbar2 <- mean(x)
prop_greater_than12 <- (data.frame(x) %>% filter(x >= 12) %>% nrow()) / (data.frame(x) %>% nrow() ) 
xbar2 
prop_greater_than12
```
####Answer: The mean of our randombly drawn sample is 10.29 and the proportion of drawn values that were greater than 12 is 0.32. 

###c. Is a mean of 12 unusual for a sample of size 30 from Exp(1/10)?
####Answer: It is higher than we would expect but with a such a small sample, it's not unbelievable. 

##3. 
### A researcher believes that in recent years women have been getting taller. She knows that 10 years ago the average height of young adult women living in her city was 63 inches (sigma = 3). She randomly samples eight young adult women currently residing in her city and measures their heights. The following data are obtained (Height, in inches): 64, 66, 68, 60, 62, 65, 66, 63
```{r}
ht <- data.frame(ht = c(64, 66, 68, 60, 62, 65, 66, 63))
```

###a. What is the alternative hypothesis? (In evaluating this experiment, assume a non-directional hypothesis is appropriate because there are insufficient theoretical and empirical bases to warrant a directional hypothesis.)
$$ H_A : Womens \space average \space height \space is \space changing \space in \space recent \space years $$ 

###b. What is the null hypothesis?
$$ H_0 : Womens \space average \space height \space is \space not \space changing \space in \space recent \space years $$   

###c. Using the generic test statistic formula given in class, what is the appropriate numerator?
#### Answer: assuming the null hypothesis, the test statistic numerator follows: 
$$ numerator = (\bar{x_1} - \mu_0) = 1.25 $$ 

```{r}
xbar1 <- mean(ht$ht)  
mu0 <- 63
xbar1
mu0
numerator <- xbar1-mu0
numerator 

s <- sd(ht$ht)
s

n <- ht %>% nrow()
n

denominator <- s / sqrt(n)
denominator

t.stat <- numerator / denominator
t.stat
```

###d. Using the generic test statistic formula given in class, what is the appropriate denominator?
Answer: 
$$ SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 0.901 $$

###e. Using a = 0.01, what is/are the critical value(s) of the test statistic?
#### Answer: Because we have assumed a non-directional hypothesis we must treat this as a two tailed test. From this, we can calculate the critical values by a t-table lookup or our quantile function. The t-statistic can be thought of as a centered and normalized confidence interval. 
$$ critical \space values = \pm 2.58$$

```{r}
crit_val <- c(qnorm(0.01/2), qnorm(1-0.01/2))
crit_val
```

###f. Using a = 0.01, what is the conclusion? (i.e. do we reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis, and why?)
####Answer: Our sample mean is inside of our critical values and therefore we cannot reject the null hypothesis as there is insufficient separation of the populations to justify statistical significance.
$$ critical \space values = \pm 2.58 \\ t.stat = 1.38$$

###g. Looking at the actual data, how does the sample standard deviation compare to that of the population?
####Answer: The sd of the sample is 2.6 which is comprable to the population sd of 3. 

##4.
###The mean height reported by men on the dating website OKCupid is approximately 5 feet 11 inches. For men living in the US, heights are normally distributed with a mean of 5 feet 9 inches, sigma=3 inches.

###a. State the null and alternative hypotheses.
#### H_a : Men using OK cupid are taller than men living in the U.S. 
#### H_0 : Men using OK cupid are not taller than men living in the U.S. 

###b. What is/are the critical value(s) of that test statistic (assume aa = .05, 2-tailed)? That is, for which values of the test statistic would you reject the null hypothesis?
####Answer: For a t.statistic outside of this bounded region, we would reject the null hypothesis, that is, t-statistics greater than 1.96 or less than -1.96. 
$$ critical \space values = \pm 1.96$$

```{r}

cLOW <- qnorm(0.05/2)
cUP <- qnorm(1 - 0.05/2)

c(cLOW, cUP)
```


##5.

```{r}
qt(1-0.05/2, df=12-1)
qt(1-0.01/2, df=20-1)
qt(1-0.05/2, df=2-1)
```

### a. N=12; a=.05

####Answer: 12.7

qt(1-0.05, df = 8-1)
qt(1-0.01, df = 15-1)
qt(1-0.025, df = 51-1)
```

### d. N=8; a=.05
####Answer: 1.89

####Answer: 2.62

### f. N=51; a=.025
####Answer: 2.01
